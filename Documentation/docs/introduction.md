# Introduction

## What is UnityEnvironmentSettings?
UnityEnvironmentSettings is a solution for managing environment-specific settings in Unity projects. It enables developers to separate configuration data from code, making their projects easier to maintain and adapt to different environments such as development, staging, and production.

## Key Features
- **Environment-Based Settings**: Seamlessly load and manage configurations for multiple environments.
- **Customizable Loaders**: Use built-in loaders (e.g., Resources, ScriptableObjects) or implement custom loaders.
- **Easy Integration**: Works with Unity's built-in tools and provides a straightforward API.

## Why Use UnityEnvironmentSettings?
- Simplifies the process of managing environment-specific configurations in Unity projects.
- Reduces the risk of hardcoding sensitive or environment-specific data.
- Makes transitioning between development and production environments effortless.

## How It Works
UnityEnvironmentSettings is built around the concept of *environment loaders*. These loaders are responsible for retrieving configuration data, which is then stored in `EnvironmentSettings` objects. The `EnvironmentSettingsManager` serves as the central point for loading and accessing these settings.

Hereâ€™s a simplified overview of the workflow:
1. A loader (e.g., `ResourcesEnvironmentLoader`) retrieves settings data.
2. The settings are passed to the `EnvironmentSettingsManager`.
3. Developers access the settings via the `EnvironmentSettings` API.
