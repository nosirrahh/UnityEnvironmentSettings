# Unity Environment Settings

UnityEnvironmentSettings is a solution for managing environment-specific settings in Unity projects. It enables developers to separate configuration data from code, making their projects easier to maintain and adapt to different environments such as development, staging, and production.

## Prerequisites
Before using UnityEnvironmentSettings, ensure you have:
- **Unity Editor**: Version 2022.1 or later.
- **Basic C# Knowledge**: Understanding of Unity's scripting workflow.
- **TextMeshPro**: Installed via Unity Package Manager (if using samples).

## Installation
### Option 1: Clone the Repository
1. Clone the repository from GitHub:
   ```bash 
   git clone https://github.com/nosirrahh/UnityEnvironmentSettings.git 
   ```
2. Open the project in Unity.
### Option 2: Unity Package Manager
1. Open your Unity project.
2. Add the package via the Package Manager:
   ```
   https://github.com/nosirrahh/UnityEnvironmentSettings.git?path=Assets/UnityEnvironmentSettings/package.json
   ```

## Configuration
### Step 1: Create Environment Settings
1. Navigate to Assets > Create > Packages > UnityEnvironmentSettings > EnvironmentSettings.
2. Configure the environment and key-value pairs as needed.
### Step 2: Create a Loader
Use the built-in ResourcesEnvironmentLoader:
* Place the settings file in the Resources folder.
* Name the file according to your environment, e.g., EnvironmentSettings.Development.asset.
### Step 3: Initialize the Loader
Add the following script to your project:
```csharp
IEnvironmentLoader loader = new ResourcesEnvironmentLoader();
loader.Init(new Dictionary<string, string> {
    { ResourcesEnvironmentLoader.ResourcesPathKey, "EnvironmentSettings.Development" }
});
```
### Step 4: Load and access settings
Hereâ€™s how to load and access settings:
```csharp
EnvironmentSettingsManager.Load(
    loader,
    (EnvironmentSettings settings) => {
        Debug.Log($"Environment: {settings.Environment}");
        foreach (var kv in settings.Settings)
            Debug.Log($"Key: {kv.key}, Value: {kv.value}");
    }
);
```
